# Piechat

## Chat Application - Back End

Frontend was built with VueJS, and Backend with django rest framework.
Vuex was used to manage the state changes.
A custom user model was created for the database, as I always do, in order to enable flexibility over
the fields to use in the database
Token authentication was used as the authentication mechanism.
